# Menu4MeNU

This project is designed to solve one of the most common daily problems: What do I cook, what do I need to buy, and how do I do it without wasting time or money?
MeNU is a smart recipe, grocery, and meal-planning assistant that adapts to real households. It tells you what meals you can cook with what you already have, what meals you should cook based on your nutrition goals, and where to find the cheapest ingredients—automatically keeping you organized every week.
